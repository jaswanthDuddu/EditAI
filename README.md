# **EditAI**

## Vision
EditAI aims to revolutionize the monotony of the video editing process through the integration of artificial intelligence. The software will analyze user input clips and identify segments to either trim or keep. The user will have the option to enter a video description, and machine learning will be employed to customize the video in relation to this topic or style of editing.


## Goals
Our primary goal is to combine the power of artificial intelligence with video editing, making it a more accessible and efficient process. Here are the main objectives of our application:
* Automated Editing
> EditAI will automatically trim video clips and identify essential segments to create a seamless and cohesive video.
* Customization
> Users can provide a video description or specify an editing style, and EditAI will utilize machine learning to tailor the video according to these preferences.
* Enhanced Effects
> The software will utilize OpenAI to predict the best speed, transitions, color correction, and other post-processing effects to match the desired video style. For example, it will make a wedding video slow and dreamy or a sports video fast and upbeat.
