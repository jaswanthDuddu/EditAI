## Description
Our application aims to combine artificial intelligence with the monotony of video editing to enhance and simplify the experience. Users will input video clips and the AI will trim them down and locate important segments of the video to keep. Then, it will compile all the clips into one cohesive video. It will also provide an additional function, using open AI, to best predict the speed, transitions color correction, and other post-processing effects used to render the style of the video best. For example, a wedding video will be slow and dreamy, while a sports video will be fast and upbeat. Our goals of learning about OpenAI and machine learning will help us with this mission, and find the best possible way to achieve our goals
