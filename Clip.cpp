/*
UNUSED MOTION DETECTION EXPERIMENTATION:

Although interesting, and perhaps useful eventually, optical flow is far too expensive and takes too much time for what it's worth.
It is also has difficulty percieving when an object is TOO blurry, and finetuning the settings seems unneccessary for it's cost.
The purpose was too begin the footage when there is little motion, but it seems there are more efficient methods available.

	- performing calculations to estimate the scope of focus in the video (start and stop times).
	- Create instead of a human facial detector, a horse detector to know when or if there's a horse.
	- training an AI model to know when to start and stop using "bad" or "good" labels if the camera is too blurry (still seems cost intensive but more probable).


IMPORTANT CONCEPTS LEARNED:

OPTICAL FLOW FURTHER DISCUSSED/FOUND IN MUTLIVARIABLE CALCULUS
Computes the optical flow between two frames(previous frame and the current gray frame)
//Uses Farneback algorithm and optical flow (pattern of motion)
//Finds point. Compares the change of that point after each frame iteration. Therefore, calculating the rate of change of the point/object.
//Pixel cooresponds to a binary value to represent brightness
//Uses image derivaties to see changes in grayscale. Takes very small displacement values between the images (derivatives) to form a polynomial approximation.
//I(x,y,t) = I(x+dx, y+dy, t+dt) where I represents the image intensity, and it's parameters represent its pixels (spacial cordinates) over time.
//When taking the taylor series (approximates function based on infinite sum of derivatives) it gives a polynomial formula to APPROXIMATE the motion vector at a specific pixel.


//prev, next, flow, pyr_scale, levels, winsize, iterations, poly_n, poly_sigma, flags
//flow is the image which represents the optical flow
